## The Deployment Journey

It took a few steps, but we got there! The main issues were:

1.  **Astro `base` configuration** to match the repository name (`/my-blog-znoopy`).
2.  **Disabling Jekyll** with the `.nojekyll` file.
3.  **Ensuring the `docs/` (or `dist/`) folder** was pushed to GitHub.
4.  **Selecting the correct folder** in the GitHub Pages settings.

Now that the pipeline is set up, blogging will be much smoother!

### 3. Deploying Your New Post

Astro automatically handles updating the index and RSS feed when you create a new Markdown file.

1.  **Build the site** to create the new static files:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    (This updates the files inside your `docs/` folder.)
2.  **Commit the new content** and the updated build output:
    ```bash
    git add -A
    git commit -m "feat: added first blog post"
    ```
3.  **Push to GitHub** to trigger the deployment:
    ```bash
    git push origin master
    ```

Once the GitHub Action completes (green checkmark), your new post will be live on your site!
